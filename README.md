# Better-Standards-for-Cartographic-Styling
This repository contains the Java code, SLD files, XSD schema, UML models and the data used to implemente the Classify extension and ProportionalSymbol extension.



The following is the introduction of the data and code used to implement the extension proposed in my thesis.

If you want to reproduce the results of my MSc thesis with the code provided in this folder, you need to install Eclipse and Maven on your computer. And download the entire folder to your local folder. The "customstyle_classify" folder stores the JAVA code that reproduces the results of the thesis. The "data" folder stores the data needed to reproduce the results. There are SLD style files for rendering the map in the "SLD files" folder. SLD files and vector data are input data to reproduce the results of the paper.

If you want to implement the Classify extension, please replace the original gt-render.jar in Geotools with the gt-render.jar provided in this folder.
